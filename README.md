## Introduction

This project aims to provide a graphical desktop application that simplifies the creation of Timetables. Timetabling problems fall within the category of combinatorial optimization and are classified as NP-Complete. As such, this task can be extremely difficult and time consuming for large datasets.

The data used on this project must follow the [International Timetabling Competition 2019](https://www.itc2019.org/home) format. The only deviations from the format were the exclusion of students and the addition of teachers.

The algorithms used on the timetabling creation were two. The first algorithm is used on the creation of an initial timetable, which will then be optimized. Said algorithm follows the framework proposed by Tomáš Müller in his [Ph.D. Thesis](https://muller.unitime.org/phd-thesis.pdf). The second algorithm is used to optimize the initial solution and uses Simulated Annealing to do so. This approach is based on [Edon Gashi and Kadri Sylejmani's approach](https://github.com/edongashi/itc-2019). Every parameter can be changed in the graphical interface.

## Building

Java JDK (11 or higher) and Maven are required to build the application

To build go to the folder ./TimetableGenerator and execute the following command:

```
mvn package
```

After the previous command has completed two jar files were generated on the target folder. Execute the jar file with "-jar-with-dependencies" in its name. To execute a jar file simply double click it or run the command:

```
java -jar TimetableGenerator-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
